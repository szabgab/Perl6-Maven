Strings can be stored in so called scalar variables.
Each such variable starts with a <emp>$</emp> sign and then alphanumeric characters, underscore or dash.
Before using such a variable the first time one has to declare it by the <emp>my</emp> keyword.

<code lang="perl6">
my $this_is_a_variable;
my $ThisIsAnotherVariableButWeDontLikeItSoMuch;
my $this-is-a-variable;
</code>

Variables are case sensitive.

<code lang="perl6">
my $h;
my $H;
</code>

By default scalar variables have no specific types but later we will see how
can we restrict the values a scalar can hold to a number or to any other type.

One can also declare a variable without giving it an inital value:

<code lang="perl6">
my $x;
</code>

In such case the value of the variable will be <b>Any()</b> which
is just case of being not <b>defined</b>.
